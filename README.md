# Urbanic-Redesign-

**About Urbanic:**
Urbanic fashion is a fusion of streetwear,
hip-hop influences, and urban culture. It
blends casual and sporty elements with
bold designs, reflecting city life. It draws
from streetwear with oversized tees,
hoodies, sneakers, and denim. Hip-hop
culture adds baggy pants, graphic tees,
tracksuits, and accessories like chains and
caps. Urban vibes are captured through
energy, diversity, and creativity. Versatile
and self-expressive, it mixes styles and
adapts to personal preferences. It has
influenced mainstream fashion, bridging
high fashion and urban culture. With broad
appeal, urbanic fashion embodies urban
communities and their dynamic spirit in a
vibrant style.


**Revamped Onboarding Journey:**
A. In our revamped onboarding process, we have made
significant improvements to enhance user
experience. One notable change is the reduction in
the number of pages, streamlining the overall flow
and making it more concise. By eliminating
unnecessary steps and consolidating information, we
aim to make the onboarding journey more efficient
and time-saving for users.
B. Additionally, we have implemented clear and intuitive
filters, allowing users to easily navigate and customize
their preferences. By providing transparent filter
options, we empower users to refine their search and
quickly find the content or features they are looking
for, enhancing their overall satisfaction with the app.
C. Furthermore, we have focused on ensuring clarity throughout
the onboarding process. By using clear and straightforward
language, as well as intuitive visual cues, we aim to eliminate any
ambiguity or confusion that users might encounter. This clarity
helps users understand the app's functionality, features, and
how to navigate through different sections.
D. We have introduced flexible view modes, allowing users to
personalize their experience by selecting their preferred
display options. With grid or list view modes, users can
customize their visual preferences and browsing habits,
enhancing their control and overall experience.
